<p>I'm a high school student interested in Full-Stack Web Development. I have been programming since 2017, and I'm experienced in Python, frontend JavaScript, and a bit of SQL. I'm also into Microservices and Application scaling.</p>

<p>I also used to do Discord Bot development before and worked extensively with the Discord API (in Python). One of my Bots got verified, but I decided to shut it down because I lost inspiration in working on it. For web development, I use React and Flask <b>a lot</b>. My favorite database is PostgreSQL. For APIs, I have started to use GraphQL recently, and I love it.</p>

<p>I'm also heavily interested in teaching others how to code. When I was a beginner, I faced a lot of difficulties because there were barely any tutorials on a some topics. That's why I make tutorials so that others don't have to face the same obstacles as me. Here's my <a href="https://youtube.com/c/ahnafzamil">YouTube channel.</a></p>

<h4>This is my GitHub repository where you will see some weird projects that I have worked on, but maybe some cool ones too (based on how you define "cool").</h4>
