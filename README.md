I'm a **Backend & Systems Developer** passionate about building scalable systems, distributed architectures, and high-performance backend services; or just whatever bizzare idea that comes to my mind.

Since 2018, Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from real-time APIs to distributed event-driven systems. I like when stuff goes towards the deep end of things.

I once invented a (*useless*) network protocol for fun and also made a search engine that scraped 1+ million pages in 12 hours (then I reset my PC without committing it to a repo and lost the entire codebase...)

Stuff I do:
- Backend development - APIs, real-time applications, background workers
- Distributed systems - message queues, event-driven architecture, high availability
- Infrastructure - Docker, CI/CD, deployment automation, server orchestration
- Networking at edge - load balancing, reverse proxies, service meshes

Some interesting facts:
- Made an Arduino robot for a school science fair when I was 13 and won the entire thing.
- Created a YT channel for tech tutorials and discussions at 14. 
- Coded a ransomware (for learning purposes) at 15 y/o and accidentally encrypted 400 GB of files in my own PC and I could not decrypt them...
- Founded an Ed-Tech platform for the people in my country to learn tech in their native tongue when I was 16. 
- Got 1st place in a national IT Olympiad competition when I was 17 with absolutely no prep.
