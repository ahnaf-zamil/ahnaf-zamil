# Hi, I'm Ahnaf ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Backend & Systems Developer who enjoys building scalable systems, distributed architectures, and high-performance backend services.

Over the last 5+ years, I've worked on projects ranging from API development to distributed event-driven systems using technologies like PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS, and Redis. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code and robust system design.

Some areas I like working with:

- Backend Development (APIs, real-time apps, system services)
- Distributed Systems & Event-Driven Architecture
- Cloud Infrastructure, Docker, and Deployment
- Edge Networking â€” Load Balancing, Service Meshes, Proxies

## ðŸ”§ Tech I work with

`Python` | `Go` | `C/C++` | `TypeScript` | `Lua` | `PostgreSQL` | `Redis` | `RabbitMQ` | `Kafka` | `NATS` | `Docker` | `Linux` | `Cloud Platforms` | `Kubernetes` | `Distributed Systems`

## Currently Learning
1. Observability (metrics, tracing, logging at scale)
2. High-frequency networking and edge computing concepts

## ðŸ“« Reach out

I'm always open to connecting and talking about tech, systems, or just exchanging ideas!
